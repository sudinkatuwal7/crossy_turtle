# Turtle Crossing 🐢

A fun Python game built with **Turtle graphics** where you guide a turtle across a busy road, avoid moving cars, and level up as you progress!  

This project demonstrates **Python OOP principles**, random object generation, collision detection, and game logic.  

---

## 🎮 How to Play

- Use the **Up arrow key** to move the turtle forward.
- Avoid the cars moving across the screen.
- Reach the **finish line** at the top to level up.
- Each level increases the speed of the cars, making the game more challenging.
- Colliding with a car ends the game.

---

## 🛠 Features

- **Player Turtle:** Move up across the screen.
- **Cars:** Randomly generated, move horizontally across the screen.
- **Collision Detection:** Game ends if the turtle collides with a car.
- **Scoring & Levels:** Score increases when the player reaches the finish line. Cars speed up each level.
- **Clean OOP Design:** Classes for Player, CarManager, and Scoreboard.
